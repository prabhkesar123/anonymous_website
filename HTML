            <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">What is a hacker.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A computer hacker is a computer expert who uses their technical
                knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.

                Though the term "hacker" has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker" – someone who
                utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data
                which would otherwise be unavailable to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in
                legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to
                collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such
                as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.[1][2]
                Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work.
                Oppositely, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security
                agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by State actors as a weapon of both legal and
                illegal warfare.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">General Defenation</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals,
                due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s.[5] This includes what hacker slang calls
                "script kiddies", people breaking into computers using programs written by others, with very little
                knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is
                largely unaware that different meanings exist.[6] While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is
                generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture
                consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by
                calling security breakers "crackers" (analogous to a safecracker).

                The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about
                with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is
                supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals.[7]

                As the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In
                popular usage and in the media, "computer intruders" or "computer criminals" is the exclusive meaning of
                the word today. (For example, "An Internet 'hacker' broke through state government security systems in
                March.") In the computer enthusiast (Hacker Culture) community, the primary meaning is a complimentary
                description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert. (For example, "Linus Torvalds,
                the creator of Linux, is considered by some to be a hacker.") A large segment of the technical community
                insist the latter is the "correct" usage of the word (see the Jargon File definition below).</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">White hat hacker
                White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities
                that can be mitigated. White hats are usually employed by the target system's owner and are typically
                paid (sometimes quite well) for their work. Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system
                owner's consent.

                Black hat hacker
                Black hats or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data,
                and are usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a black hat
                hacker,[18] but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make profits or to
                benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often use them to
                their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat
                hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.

                Grey hat hacker
                Grey hats include those who hack for fun or to troll. They may both fix and exploit vulnerabilities, but
                usually not for financial gain. Even if not malicious, their work can still be illegal, if done without
                the target system owner's consent, and grey hats are usually associated with black hat hackers.</p>
